# CapturMate

CapturMate is a macOS application designed to help users effortlessly capture screenshots and extract text from images. The app allows users to upload images or capture screen areas, recognize text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and copy the extracted text to the clipboard for further use. It is an ideal tool for students, professionals, and anyone who needs to digitize printed or displayed text.

## Features

- **Capture and Upload Images**: Easily upload images from the file system or capture screenshots for text extraction.
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Extract text from images using macOS's built-in Vision framework for OCR.
- **Copy Text to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the recognized text to the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface designed for macOS, with a consistent macOS-style appearance.
- **Support for Multiple Image Formats**: Works with popular image formats like PNG and JPEG.
